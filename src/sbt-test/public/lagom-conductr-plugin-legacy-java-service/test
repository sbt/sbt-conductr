##
## This test starts a sandbox, deploys a LagomJava service and executes an HTTP request through the Service
## Gateway to ensure the service is reachable. It intentionally uses an old version of Lagom to test for
## backward compatibility.
## In the process, it ensures the bundle is listed in `conduct info` and also ensures an `install.sh`
## script is created.
